// Exercise: Creating arrays and objects

// In this exercise lab you will practice creating arrays and objects.
// Tasks to complete:

// Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.
var clothes = []

// Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.
clothes.push("clothing 1")
clothes.push("clothing 2")
clothes.push("clothing 3")
clothes.push("clothing 4")
clothes.push("clothing 5")

// Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.
clothes.pop()

// Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.
clothes.push("new clothing")

// Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.
console.log(clothes)

// Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.
var favCar = {}

// Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.
favCar.color = "red"

// Using the dot notation, assign a covertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.
favCar["covertible"] = true

// Use the console to log the entire favCar object.
console.log(favCar)
